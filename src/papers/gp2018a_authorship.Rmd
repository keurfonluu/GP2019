K. Luu and M. Noble conceived the presented idea and respectively implemented the optimization and forward modeling codes. K. Luu developed the theory and performed the computations. P. Thierry helped on the parallel implementation of the codes and the scalability analysis. A. Gesret provided valuable feedback on the analysis of the numerical results. K. Luu wrote the manuscript with inputs from all authors.
